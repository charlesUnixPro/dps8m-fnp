Commands sent from dps8m to fFNP:

    tellFFNP (int fnp_no, char * command);

        fnp_no: Later, when we have multiple FNPs, this will mean something.

        command:

            "bootload" 
                This command indicates that Multics has indicated that
                FNP should restart, reload it's configuration tables,
                and reset it's state data.

            "accept_calls"
                Sets the state of the FNP to accepting
                incoming calls. Reset state is not accepting.

            "dont_accept_calls"
                Sets the state of the FNP to not accepting
                incoming calls. Reset state is not accepting.

            "listen %d %d %d"
                First parameter is 0 (disable) or 1 (enable).
                Second parameter is line number (0 - 31) of a HSLA line.
                Third parameter is input buffer size.
                Enable or disable listening for incoming calls on the indicated
                HSLA line.

            "accept_output %d <encoded_data>"
            "accept_last_output %d <encoded_data>"

Commands sent from fFNP to DPS8m:

    tellDPS8 (char * command)

        command:

            "accept_new_terminal %d %d %d"
                Dialup has been received on a channel.
                First parameter is line number (0-31) of a HSLA line.
                Second parameter is the line type of the channel.
                    1 is ASCII.
                    (-1 is TELNET; interesting...)
                    See line_types.incl.pl1
                Third parameter is baud_rate of an autobaud channel,
                or 0. (This affect buffer sizes on the Multics side.)

                    dcl  baud_table (15) fixed bin int static options (constant) init
                         (110, 133, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 7200,
                          9600, 19200, 40800, 50000, 72000);
